## Features & Usage

### Server Status Monitoring
- **Status Notifications:** Periodically checks the Project Epoch API and notifies Discord channels when the auth server or the Kezan world server comes online.
- **Opt-in User Pings:** Users can opt-in or out of Kezan notifications by reacting to a bot message.
    - Use `!notifyme` ‚Äî The bot posts a message. React with üîî to opt-in for Kezan notifications. Remove your reaction to opt out.
    - **Note:** If you use `!notifyme` again, reacting to the new message will keep you opted in. To opt out, you must remove your üîî reaction from the latest message; only then will you stop receiving notifications. Reacting again will opt you back in.
- **Admin Channel Configuration:** Server admins can set which channel receives notifications.
    - Use `!setchannel #channel` ‚Äî Set the channel for status notifications (admin only).
- **Manual Status Check:**
    - Use `!status` ‚Äî Manually check and display the current server status.

### Gambling System üé∞

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/JesterCharles/epoch-status-bot.git
cd epoch-discord-bot
```


### 2. (Recommended) Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
Make sure you have Python 3.9+ installed.

On **Windows**:
```sh
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```
On **macOS/Linux**:
```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Python Dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Your Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root (see `.env.example` for reference):
```env
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here #SENSITIVE INFORMATION NEVER UPLOAD TO GITHUB
API_URL=https://project-epoch-status.com/api/status/realms
CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS=10
COMMAND_PREFIX=!
DATABASE_FILE=bot_settings.db
```
- **Never share your real `.env` file or bot token publicly!**

### 5. Run the Bot
```sh
python epoch-status.py
```

The bot will automatically:
- Create the SQLite database file on first run
- Initialize gambling system tables
- Start monitoring server status
- Begin the daily rollover task for gambling features

**First-time Gambling Setup:**
1. Use `!set-gamble-channel #your-gambling-channel` to designate a gambling channel (optional but recommended)
2. The bot will automatically post and pin gambling rules in the designated channel
3. Users can start betting immediately with their starting 100 epochs!

## Gambling System Philosophy

The gambling system is designed to **keep the community engaged and entertained** while waiting for Project Epoch server launches. Key design principles:

- **Fair & Fun:** Everyone starts equal with the same balance
- **Community Building:** Donation system encourages helping others
- **No Real Money:** Uses fictional "epochs" currency - just for fun!
- **Automatic Management:** Minimal admin intervention required
- **Timezone Friendly:** Supports players across different time zones
- **Persistent Engagement:** Daily claims keep players coming back

The system automatically handles all daily operations, jackpot management, and winner calculations, making it easy for server admins to set up and forget while providing ongoing entertainment for the community.

## API Reliability & Future Improvements

- **External API Dependency:**
    - The bot currently uses the `API_URL` specified in your `.env` file to check server status. This is an external resource and may occasionally go down or become unavailable, which will affect the bot's ability to provide updates.
- **Planned Improvements:**
    - Future updates aim to add direct pinging of the Epoch server itself, improving reliability and providing more robust checks and balances for server status.

---

## Security & Best Practices
- **Never commit your real `.env` or bot token.**
- If your token is ever leaked, regenerate it in the Discord Developer Portal immediately.
- The bot only stores minimal, non-sensitive user data:
  - Discord user IDs and usernames for notification opt-ins
  - Gambling balances, bets, and preferences (all tied to Discord user IDs)
  - Server configuration settings per guild
- **All gambling data is stored locally** in your SQLite database and never shared externally.
